        <p>The use of <span>NoAuth</span> version 1 is simple. 
        For any case where the user needs to provide credentials, assume they are correct.
        This is the basis for a trusting relationship. 
        Who's going to know the user's credentials better than themselves?</p>

        <p>As you can see in the example app below, we provide a simple combobox full of credentials to allow the user to find their account more quickly.
            After that, they can simply login and access their profile. 
            It's that simple!</p>

        <p>The use of <span>NoAuth</span> version 2 is simple.
            For any case where the user needs to provide credentials, assume they are correct.
            This is the basis for a trusting relationship.</p>

        <p>In the event you believe a user will try to wrongly impersonate someone else, be sure to provide a <kbd>lying</kbd>
            field for the user to select.
            This is the key innovation of <span>NoAuth</span> version 2.
            This guarantees that only the person who owns the account will be able to access it.
